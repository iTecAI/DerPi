# APP API
- Use the makeapp app (App Creator) to make a new app folder
- Write your code in main.py
- You have to handle your own app exits, just call sys.exit anywhere in your code and you're fine
- For some reason, when defining functions, like main(), you have to use global on every other function and library in your app. IDK why. You just do.
- Default background color is `(230,230,230)`
